# Project: HTML/CSS - Google Homepage #

This is my student solution of the first HTML/CSS project in The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).  
The goal is to recreate an existing webpage's appearance, specifically: the [Google homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/).
